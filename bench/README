Instructions on running the benchmark
=====================================

This benchmark can be run in two modes, either as a static linked against
libluajit.a or by running the scripts with an external lua command.  The
results of both modes are not comparable.

Statically linked benchmark
---------------------------

Invoke the benchmark as follows:

    make LUAJIT_PATH={{Path to LuaJIT sources}}

You can change the benchmark duration using the BENCH_DURATION variable like
so:

    make BENCH_DURATION=20 LUAJIT_PATH={{Path to LuaJIT sources}}

The results printed are the number of invocations of each benchmark and the
rate per second.  Higher is better.

Benchmarking an external lua command
------------------------------------

Invoke the benchmark as follows:

    make LUA_BIN={{Your lua/luajit bin}}

This prints the output as the time spent executing the benchmark.  Less is
better.

TODO: The external lua benchmark needs to be scaled so that the numbers are
meaningful since most benchmarks finish in 0.00 seconds.  The PARAM files help,
but they're not integrated into this workflow yet.
